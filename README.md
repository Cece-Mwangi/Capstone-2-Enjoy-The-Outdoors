# Capstone-2-Enjoy-The-Outdoors
For this Capstone I implemented the JavaScript to display the options for the mountain page and the parks page.
For the Location page I used dropdown selectors to display the options for the location and the park type.
To display those options I used a table and called to it in the scripts.
For the Mountains page i also used drop down selectors and tables
The most interesting code to write was the images corresponding with the mountain choices.
